“how does cost and travel time varies for plane vs. train travel
within Great Britain?”
We have transportation data in a csv file which contains Ticket cost and Time required to commute between
importaint cities across multiple county's in the UK.

In the given code, I have visualised and compare Cost and Time required to travel between major cities in the UK using Train and Plane
using various graphs.

Required Libraries are:

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot 
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
